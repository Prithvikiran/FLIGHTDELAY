Flight delays have significant consequences for passengers, airlines and the aviation
industry. Predicting these delays accurately is crucial for optimizing airline
operations and improving the overall passenger experience. This involves a twostage
machine learning engine that forecasts the on-time performance of flights.
Through the integration of classification for categorical delay outcomes and regression
for continuous delay duration, our methodology offers a comprehensive
and precise prediction framework. This Project contributes to the improvement
of aviation operations and passenger experience by enhancing the accuracy of
flight delay forecasts.
